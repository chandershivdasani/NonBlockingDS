This project implements some common data structures using non blocking mechanism. Writing nonblocking data structures and algorithms have been made possible in Java, 
starting 5.0 by the addition of atomic hardware primitives like compare-and-swap(CAS). java.util.concurrent makes extensive use of this. 

Non blocking algorithms are concurrent algorithms where thread safety is implemented using CAS and not locks. They can be either Lock free i.e there is 
a guaranteed system wide progress or Wait free i.e there is a guaranteed per thread progress.

Currently implemented data structures:

NonBlockingStack:
	 A non-blocking implementation of Stack. Unlike the stack implementation in java.util.Stack, this Stack iterates in LIFO order.
